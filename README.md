# Scripts That Work

A list of scripts that I made over the years to make my professional work easier.  

## Disclaimer

I wrote these scripts without any direction from the companies I worked for. I did not get paid to build any of these, and I wrote these on my own time using using my own personal equipment.  

This is a non-profit project designed to make note taking easier.  
KaVo:tm:, DTX Studio:tm:, DEXIS:tm:, Gendex:tm:, i-CAT:tm:, Soredex:tm:, Instrumentarium:tm:, and any logos thereof are all owned by KaVo Kerr under the Envista Holdings Corp portfolio.  

SoftDent:tm: is a trademark owned by Carestream Dental  

I do not own, nor will attempt to profit from the brands mentioned above. This is to merely showcase my skills.  

These scripts do not come with any warranty, so use at your own risk.
